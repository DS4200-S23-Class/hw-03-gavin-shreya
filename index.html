                                <li>Color represents the scoring value of each of the batted balls, where below average hits are purple, above average hits are orange, and average hits are closer to white</li>
                                <li>Overall this is a good choice because it is easy to distinguish between the different colors as well as understand that if a score gets closer to average it becomes lighter</li>

                                <li>The color saturation represents the score of the batted balls, specifically differing in intensity based on how far the ball is from the average. Scores that are further from the average are represented with more intense coloring with a higher saturations, while scores closer to the average are represented with less intensity and lower saturation</li>
                                <li>This is a good choice as it lets the viewers quickly understand what scores are close to average and which scores are further above or below average</li>

                                <li>Good choice because it creates an easy to understand visualization of which balls had higher or lower velocities and launch angles</li>

                                <li>This is a good choice because it is easy for viewers to understand that the extremities of the range represent the darker colors and the more neutral color is represented but he average scores</li>
